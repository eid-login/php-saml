# Fork of OneLogin's SAML PHP Toolkit for eID-Templates

This is a fork of [OneLogin's SAML PHP Toolkit](https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml/), which has been created to make the Toolkit match the needs of the eID-Templates project.

The main changes are:
* Support for SAML-Redirect Binding
* Support for AuthnRequestExtensions
* Usage of a fork of robrichards/xmlseclibs with support for RSASSA-PSS
